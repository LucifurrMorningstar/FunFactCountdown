# FunFactCountdown
Are you tired of twiddling your thumbs while waiting for the fight to start?
Are you bored to death waiting for the Astrologian's cards?
Are your friends lacking entertainment value while you sit on your ass pre-pull with nothing to do?

**Well now, through the power of Dalamud, you can start start a countdown that sends fun facts to your chat while you wait!**
With over 1,000 fun facts to choose from and custom fact intervals, you can enhance your gameplay enjoyment while you watch as the Dancer pre-pull's Technical Step.

Use /ffcd to start a countdown and send fun facts to your chat at specified intervals.

For example: **"/ffcd 15 10 5 0"** will start a 15s countdown and send a fun fact at **10s, 5s, and 0s**. If you don't specify any intervals, a Fun Fact is sent every second of the countdown (i.e. "/ffcd 15")

**NOTE**: This will send to your currently selected chat channel (i.e. Say, Party, CWLS, etc.)
