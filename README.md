# FunFactCountdown
Start a countdown with fun facts sent to your chat at certain intervals!

Use /ffcd to start a countdown and send fun facts to your chat at specified intervals.

For example: **"/ffcd 15 10 5 0"** will start a 15s countdown and send a fun fact at **10s, 5s, and 0s**. If you don't specify any intervals, a Fun Fact is sent every second of the countdown (i.e. "/ffcd 15")

**NOTE**: This will send to your currently selected chat channel (i.e. Say, Party, CWLS, etc.)
